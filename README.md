### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**maldamen/maldamen** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on this code to have an automatic way of obtaining the IR peaks terms used in manuscripts like (m), (s), (br)
this will help each of students and researchers to avoid misprinted mistakes and time consuming in determining the peaks in a precise way.
the code still in its initial stage and many mathematical, chemical as well as spectroscopic terminologies and keywords to be added. 
I have been able to fit the peaks and separate them and I tried to fit them using a simple gaussian curve fitting.
